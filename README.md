This is a Ceasar Cipher, are you ready to send Encrypted messages to your friends??

Ceasar Cipher is one of the method used by Ceasar to convey the messages in an encrypted way to his people, this way only the people aware about the decrypting code can read the actual message. 

What Ceasar Cipher does is, it taked the message as an input and asks the user the shift number. This cipher will then shift the letters in the message by the shift number given as input. For example the original message is A and shift number is 5, cipher will encrypt this message and move its position by 5, the message will then read F instead of A.

In order to decode this encrypted message the reader of the message must know the shift number!
